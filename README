NAME
    rgit - Recursively execute a command on all the git repositories in a
    directory tree.

VERSION
    Version 0.06

SYNOPSIS
        rgit [-K|-I|-D|-V] [GIT_OPTIONS] COMMAND [COMMAND_ARGS]

DESCRIPTION
    This utility recursively searches in a root directory (which may be the
    current working directory or - if it has been set - the directory given
    by the "GIT_DIR" environment variable) for all git repositories, sort
    this list by the repository path, "chdir" into each of them, and
    executes the specified git command. Moreover, those formats are
    substituted in the arguments before running the command :

    *   %n with the current repository name.

    *   %g with the relative path (based from the root directory) to the
        current repository.

    *   %G with the absolute path to the current repository.

    *   %w with the relative path (based from the root directory) to the
        current repository's working directory.

    *   %W with the absolute path to the current repository's working
        directory.

    *   %b with a "bareified" relative path, i.e. %g if this is a bare
        repository, and "%w.git" otherwise.

    *   %B with an absolute version of the "bareified" path.

    *   %R with the absolute path to the root directory.

    *   "%%" with a bare "%".

    There are actually a few commands that are only executed once in the
    root directory : "daemon", "gui", "help", "init" and "version". For any
    of those, no format substitution is done.

    You can specify which "git" executable to use with the "GIT_EXEC_PATH"
    environment variable.

COMMAND LINE SWITCHES
    "rgit" takes its options as the capital switches that comes before the
    git command. It's possible to bundle them together. They are removed
    from the argument list before calling "git".

    *   "-K"

        Keep processing on error. The default policy is to stop whenever an
        error occured.

    *   "-I"

        Enables interactive mode when the standard input is a tty. Requires
        Term::ReadKey to be installed. This lets you choose interactively
        what to do when one of the commands returns a non-zero status.

    *   "-D"

        Outputs diagnostics.

    *   "-V"

        Outputs the version.

EXAMPLES
    Execute "git gc" on all the repositories below the current directory :

        rgit gc

    Tag all the repositories with their name :

        rgit tag %n

    Add a remote to all repositories in "/foo/bar" to their bare counterpart
    in "qux" on host :

        GIT_DIR="/foo/bar" rgit remote add host git://host/qux/%b

DEPENDENCIES
    The core modules Carp, Config, Cwd, Exporter, File::Find,
    File::Spec::Functions and POSIX.
