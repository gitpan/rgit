NAME
    rgit - Recursively execute a command on all the git repositories in a
    directory tree.

VERSION
    Version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
        rgit [GIT_OPTIONS] COMMAND [COMMAND_ARGS]

DESCRIPTION
    This utility recursively searches in the current directory (or in the
    directory given by the "GIT_DIR" environment variable if it's set) for
    all git repositories, sort this list by the repository path, "chdir"
    into each of them, and executes the specified git command. Moreover,
    those formats are substuted in the arguments before running the command
    :

    *   "^n" with the current repository name.

    *   "^g" with the relative path to the current repository.

    *   "^G" with the absolute path to the current repository.

    *   "^w" with the relative path to the current repository's working
        directory.

    *   "^W" with the absolute path to the current repository's working
        directory.

    *   "^b" with a "bareified" relative path, i.e. "^g" if this is a bare
        repository, and "^w.git" otherwise.

    *   "^B" with an absolute version of the "bareified" path.

    *   "^R" with the absolute path to the current root directory.

    *   "^^" with a bare "^".

    There are actually a few commands that are only executed once in the
    current directory : "version", "help", "daemon" and "init". For any of
    those, no format substitution is done.

    You can specify which "git" executable to use with the "GIT_EXEC_PATH"
    environment variable.

EXAMPLES
    Execute "git gc" on all the repositories below the current directory :

        rgit gc

    Tag all the repositories with their name :

        rgit tag ^n

    Add a remote to all repositories in "/foo/bar" to their bare counterpart
    in "qux" on host :

        GIT_DIR="/foo/bar" rgit remote add host git://host/qux/^b

DEPENDENCIES
    The core modules Carp, Cwd, Exporter, File::Find, File::Spec::Functions
    and List::Util.
